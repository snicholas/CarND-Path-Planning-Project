# CarND-Path-Planning-Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program
   
### Goals
In this project your goal is to safely navigate around a virtual highway with other traffic that is driving +-10 MPH of the 50 MPH speed limit. You will be provided the car's localization and sensor fusion data, there is also a sparse map list of waypoints around the highway. The car should try to go as close as possible to the 50 MPH speed limit, which means passing slower traffic when possible, note that other cars will try to change lanes too. The car should avoid hitting other cars at all cost as well as driving inside of the marked road lanes at all times, unless going from one lane to another. The car should be able to make one complete loop around the 6946m highway. Since the car is trying to go 50 MPH, it should take a little over 5 minutes to complete 1 loop. Also the car should not experience total acceleration over 10 m/s^2 and jerk that is greater than 10 m/s^3.

### Path generation reflection
For the path generation I've used the [Cubic Spline interpolation](https://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/) tool to create a smooth path towards new waypoints. For lane change I've evaluated the distances to other vehicles versus the actual velocity, to account for deceleration time, and safety cost for lane change.
Improvements could be to take account of physics to evaluate breaking time and lane change risk.
